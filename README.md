# JavaFX Bank
The JavaFX Bank Account Application is a group project aimed at creating a simple desktop application that allows users to manage a personal bank account. The application will consist of a graphical user interface built using the JavaFX framework that enables users to create an account, log in securely, view their account balance and transaction history, deposit and withdraw hypothetical funds, and access features typical of a basic banking app. By developing the application using Java and JavaFX, we aim to gain experience building a functional desktop program utilizing common GUI controls, data persistence, and object-oriented concepts. The project will allow us to demonstrate core programming skills as well as deliver a working application that simulates basic personal banking features in a secure, easy-to-use interface. Though no real financial transactions will occur, the application will provide the foundation for future banking projects using JavaFX, SceneBuilder and other related technologies.
